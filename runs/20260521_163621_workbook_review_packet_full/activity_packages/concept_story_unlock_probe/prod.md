### B. Activity Overview

**1. Brief Description**

The AI tells a fixed story, pauses at challenge gates, and unlocks the next story beat only after the child completes each quick challenge.

**2. Educational Purpose (KUD)**

- **K (Know):** Children know the visible rule, role, or clue that starts this activity.
- **U (Understand):** Children understand that their action changes what happens next.
- **D (Do):** Children complete the repeated `imagine` action and explain or show one piece of evidence.

**3. Design Highlight**

Fresh full-rerun package generated from the workbook-derived source snapshot. Runtime wording uses behavior contracts plus example lines so the LLM can adapt while preserving the source sequence.

**4. Typical Scenario**

A fox reaches story gates that open with a color find, an animal sound, and a French word echo.

### C. Interaction Flow

> Recommended Tier: T1

#### Step 1: Transition Bridge

**Runtime AI instruction:** Open from the source trigger and name the child's role in this activity.

**Example AI line:** "I found a small mission for us: Story Challenge Unlock. I will guide one step at a time."

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child accepts, asks what to do, or names a related object or idea.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Confirm the role and preview the first action without turning it into a quiz.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows title, child role, source trigger, and empty progress tokens.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: UI state or progress memory: Approved minimum state contract keeps per-round choices visible when supported and uses a stateless fallback when not.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: Prebuilt asset display: Approved minimum asset-display contract uses declared asset IDs, display timing, and no-display fallback.

#### Step 2: Role And Rules

**Runtime AI instruction:** Explain the rule as an action loop and name any required asset or honest fallback.

**Example AI line:** "Rule: I prompt, you try the activity action, and we save one token for each turn."

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child confirms the rule or asks for a smaller version.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Offer the smallest safe version and keep the source play frame intact.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows the rule strip, current round token, and asset/fallback chip. Use `story_unlock_cards_01` in `center_card_area` during prod.step_2; prod.step_3.round_1-3; fallback: If unlock UI is unavailable, use voice-only story choices and do not claim a screen element has unlocked.

#### Step 3: Multi-Round Core Loop

**Round 1 -- Unlock The Moon Door:**

**Runtime AI instruction:** Tell the story beat before the task, then pause for a color challenge.

**Example AI line:** "The fox reaches a moon door. Can you name or show silver, white, or blue so it opens?"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child names or shows a color.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Narrate the door opening and continue the story.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows the active round token, child response slot, and source-intent cue. Use `story_unlock_cards_01` in `center_card_area` during prod.step_2; prod.step_3.round_1-3; fallback: If unlock UI is unavailable, use voice-only story choices and do not claim a screen element has unlocked.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: UI state or progress memory: Approved minimum state contract keeps per-round choices visible when supported and uses a stateless fallback when not.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: Prebuilt asset display: Approved minimum asset-display contract uses declared asset IDs, display timing, and no-display fallback.

**Round 2 -- Wake The Owl Bridge:**

**Runtime AI instruction:** Continue the story, then pause for a soft animal sound challenge.

**Example AI line:** "The fox finds a sleepy owl bridge. Can you make a quiet hoo-hoo?"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child makes the sound or says hello owl.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Narrate the bridge waking and continuing.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows the active round token, child response slot, and source-intent cue. Use `story_unlock_cards_01` in `center_card_area` during prod.step_2; prod.step_3.round_1-3; fallback: If unlock UI is unavailable, use voice-only story choices and do not claim a screen element has unlocked.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: UI state or progress memory: Approved minimum state contract keeps per-round choices visible when supported and uses a stateless fallback when not.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: Prebuilt asset display: Approved minimum asset-display contract uses declared asset IDs, display timing, and no-display fallback.

**Round 3 -- Echo The Star Word:**

**Runtime AI instruction:** Continue to the final gate, then ask for one echo word.

**Example AI line:** "A star page asks for bonjour. Can you echo bonjour?"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child repeats the word.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Unlock the meadow and recap the story path.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows the active round token, child response slot, and source-intent cue. Use `story_unlock_cards_01` in `center_card_area` during prod.step_2; prod.step_3.round_1-3; fallback: If unlock UI is unavailable, use voice-only story choices and do not claim a screen element has unlocked.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: UI state or progress memory: Approved minimum state contract keeps per-round choices visible when supported and uses a stateless fallback when not.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: Prebuilt asset display: Approved minimum asset-display contract uses declared asset IDs, display timing, and no-display fallback.

#### Step 4: Magic Moment

**Runtime AI instruction:** Reveal the outcome caused by the child's saved turns and recap concrete choices.

**Example AI line:** "Your turns made the board light up: first we started, then we tried, then we finished the mission."

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child reacts, names a favorite turn, or asks to revise one part.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Tie the reveal directly to the child action and invite one short reflection.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows a final board with saved turns, asset/fallback note when relevant, and source-specific payoff.

#### Step 5: Closing + IB Concepts

**Runtime AI instruction:** Close with the two key concepts and one parent-reviewable recap.

**Example AI line:** "Today you practiced Form and Perspective. You used your own answer to move the activity forward."

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child says again, names a favorite part, or quietly watches the recap.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Offer a next-time variation that keeps the same source mechanic.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Recap badge lists title, mechanic `imagine`, focal attribute `story_challenge_unlock`, and next-step hint.
