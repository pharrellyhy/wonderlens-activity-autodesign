### B. Activity Overview

**1. Brief Description**

The child compares two approved artworks at a time, chooses a favorite, and keeps the winner moving until a final favorite wins.

**2. Educational Purpose (KUD)**

- **K (Know):** Children know the visible rule, role, or clue that starts this activity.
- **U (Understand):** Children understand that their action changes what happens next.
- **D (Do):** Children complete the repeated `compare` action and explain or show one piece of evidence.

**3. Design Highlight**

Fresh full-rerun package generated from the workbook-derived source snapshot. Runtime wording uses behavior contracts plus example lines so the LLM can adapt while preserving the source sequence.

**4. Typical Scenario**

Two rights-cleared artworks appear side by side each round and the child decides which one continues.

### C. Interaction Flow

> Recommended Tier: T1

#### Step 1: Transition Bridge

**Runtime AI instruction:** Open from the source trigger and name the child's role in this activity.

**Example AI line:** "I found a small mission for us: Art Critic Tournament. I will guide one step at a time."

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child accepts, asks what to do, or names a related object or idea.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Confirm the role and preview the first action without turning it into a quiz.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows title, child role, source trigger, and empty progress tokens.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: UI state or progress memory: Approved minimum state contract keeps per-round choices visible when supported and uses a stateless fallback when not.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: Prebuilt asset display: Approved minimum asset-display contract uses declared asset IDs, display timing, and no-display fallback.

#### Step 2: Role And Rules

**Runtime AI instruction:** Explain the rule as an action loop and name any required asset or honest fallback.

**Example AI line:** "Rule: I prompt, you try the activity action, and we save one token for each turn."

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) The child confirms the rule or asks for a smaller version.
2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.
3. (No response) Child stays quiet, waits, or looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Offer the smallest safe version and keep the source play frame intact.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows the rule strip, current round token, and asset/fallback chip. Use `artwork_tournament_set_01` in `center_card_area` during prod.step_2; prod.step_3.round_1-5; fallback: If the artwork set or tournament state is unavailable, block at Phase 0.

#### Step 3: Multi-Round Core Loop

**Round 1 -- Match 1:**

**Runtime AI instruction:** Show two approved artworks and ask which one should stay.

2. (Unexpected) Child gives an unrelated answer, unsafe action, or asks to change the task.

**AI follow-up:**

1. [specific] Keep the chosen artwork as winner.
2. [redirect] Validate the idea, restate the safe rule, and offer one easier choice.
3. [wait 2s] [gentle] Model a tiny answer and invite one small try.

**Screen:** Shows the active round token, child response slot, and source-intent cue. Use `artwork_tournament_set_01` in `center_card_area` during prod.step_2; prod.step_3.round_1-5; fallback: If the artwork set or tournament state is unavailable, block at Phase 0.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: UI state or progress memory: Approved minimum state contract keeps per-round choices visible when supported and uses a stateless fallback when not.
> RESOLVED BLOCKER: Prebuilt asset display: Approved minimum asset-display contract uses declared asset IDs, display timing, and no-display fallback.

**Round 2 -- Match 2:**

**Runtime AI instruction:** Bring in a new challenger against the current winner.

**Example AI line:** "Your winner meets a new artwork. Which one should continue?"
